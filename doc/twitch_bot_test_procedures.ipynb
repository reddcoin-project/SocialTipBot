      "1. Twitch chat is organised around IRC channels, one channel for each streamer.\n",
      "2. A user can join multiple Twitch IRC channels at the same time.\n",

      "4. A user can send commands to *tipreddcoin* either in the special channel *#tipreddcoin* or in channels of which *tipreddcoin* is also a viewer. In the latter case, **prepend all your commands with @tipreddcoin**, just the same way you do when you tweet a command to Twitter Tipbot."

      "5. +tip can be replaced by +give, +send, +pay\n",
      "6. **You can reverse the order of ammount and currency but then you must remove the space in between**, e.g. +pay @laudney RDD100\n",
