      "1. Follow @itipyou. This will trigger three things. 1) @itipyou will immediately send you a follow request. Please accept it asap. 2) @itipyou will also immediately create an account for you, including your Reddcoin address. 3) @itipyou will then mention you in a public tweet to inform you of the success of registrion and ask you to get more information with \"+info\" command. The reason a public tweet is used is mostly due to the fact that sending direct message is forbidden until after you accept bot's follow request. Please check all three things happen.\n",
      "2. Once you accept the follow request from @itipyou, it's time to test +info command.\n",
      "3. Using direct message, send \"+info\" to @itipyou. In your message body, you can put in any random stuff as long as \"+info\" appears in the text and with space around it. Try different variations and see whether you get account info back each time.\n",

You should get back responses in corresponding format. The difference between the two is: in public tweets, you need to put @itipyou at the beginning of the tweet so it's considered a @reply to the bot. In direct message, there is no need for that.\n",

      "1. Now the fun parts. At this stage, I'd like you to focus on tipping others already registered with the bot. You can find out who are registered by looking at the Followed and Following of the bot.\n",
      "2. The simplest tipping command is this: +tip @laudney 100 RDD in a direct message. Prepend '@itipyou ' to make it work in a public tweet.\n",
      "3. **Unlike Reddit, in twitter you must always specify target screen name.**\n",
      "4. Bot supports a large number of variations. Let's go through them:\n",
      "5. +tip can be replaced by +give, +send, +pay\n",
      "6. You can reverse the order of ammount and currency, e.g. +pay @laudney RDD 100\n",
      "7. You can replace @laudney (i.e. the screen name) with a wallet address\n",
      "8. You can replace amount with one of the keywords which will do two things a) choose an amount for you b) also generate very fun message!!\n",
      "9. All the keywords are listed in this Regular Expressoin: '(all|flip|megaflip|gigaflip|roll|megaroll|gigaroll|sushi|random01|random05|random1|random3|random5|random10|random15|random25|random50|random100|random250|random500|random1000|upvote|pi|e|leet|quarter|half|cookie|nothing|gum|beer|nicebeer|hug|kiss|nyan|highfive|fart|coffee)'\n",
      "10. However, **if you use keyword but put it behind RDD, you must NOT put space in between.**, e.g. +tip @laudney RDDsushi. You see, it's a *play on the world*: RDDsushi, Rddbeer, RDDnicebeer, RDDflip\n",
