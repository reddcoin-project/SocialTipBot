Please accept it ASAP. 2) @tipreddcoin will also immediately create a Reddcoin account for you, including your Reddcoin address. 3) @tipreddcoin will then reply to you in a public tweet to inform you of the success of registrion and ask you to get more information with \"+info\" command. The reason a public tweet is used is due to the fact that sending direct message is forbidden until after you accept bot's follow request.\n",
